  <h1>The Brain Game Lab</h1>
  <p>
    <em>Games are an enormously promising tool for research in cognitive science.</em> Traditional laboratory experiments are
    boring for the participant, expensive for the researcher, and study mostly college students at major research universities. 
    A well-designed game, on the other hand, is engaging, attracts volunteers to play, and can reach people all over the world. 
    With millions of potential participants, researchers can ask questions that have been unanswerable with traditional laboratory methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're designing The Brain Game Lab to be a home for game-based research in cognitive science. We're still in the early stages of work.
    If you are a Vassar student interested in developing games for research please get in touch with Professor Josh de Leeuw (jdeleeuw@vassar.edu).
    We're looking for students with a variety of interests and backgrounds, including graphic design, sound/music design, game design, programming, 
    and experimental research experience.
